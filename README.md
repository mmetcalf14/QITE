# QITE
Connecting the numerical QITE code to Qiskit. QITE Circuits are generated for arbitrary system Hamiltonians.

To use this code first activate the virtual environment 'virtchem', since some of the libraries have been modified to construct 
these circuits.

source ./virtchem/bin/activate

run the Jupyter Notebook to generate the circuits.
